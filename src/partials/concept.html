            It all begins with your idea. Whether it's a concept in your head, a
            rough sketch, or a collection of inspirations, this is where our
            collaboration starts. During our initial one-on-one consultation,
            we'll dive deep into what you want to create, discussing everything
            from the desired silhouette and function to the specific story you
            want your piece to tell.

          <p class="concept__text">
            Once we understand your vision, our designers get to work
            translating your ideas into detailed sketches and digital mockups.
            This is a collaborative phase where you'll see your concept take its
            first visual form and have the opportunity to provide feedback. We
            will refine the design together until every element, from the fabric
            choice to the smallest hardware detail, is absolutely perfect.
